# Total-sales-Data-Modeling-

Data Modeling is one of the features used to connect multiple data sources in BI tool using a relationship. A relationship defines how data sources are connected with each other and you can create interesting data visualisations on multiple data sources. In this project we have an excel file with many columns and most of columns have same and iterative data. With data modeling we can decrease redundancy and improve speed of reporting. Our dataset is flat with 45 columns and 120000 rows.
